\section[Maximum Likelihood Estimation Of Laplace AR(p)]{Maximum Likelihood Estimation Of Laplace AR(p)\label{ex:MaximumLikelihoodEstimationLaPlaceARp}}
Consider the AR(1) model with constant
\begin{align*}
y_t = c + \phi y_{t-1} + u_t
\end{align*}
Assume that the error terms \(u_t\) are i.i.d. Laplace distributed with known density
\begin{align*}
f_{u_{t}}(u)=\frac{1}{2}\exp \left( -|u|\right)
\end{align*}
Note that for the above parametrization of the Laplace distribution
  we have that \(E(u_t)=0\) and \(Var(u_t)=2\),
  so we are only interested in estimating \(c\) and \(\phi\)
  and not the standard deviation of \(u_t\) as it is fixed.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Derive the log-likelihood function conditional on the first observation.
\item Write a function that calculates the conditional log-likelihood of \(c\) and \(\phi\).
\item Load the dataset given in the CSV file \texttt{LaPlace.csv}.
Numerically find the maximum likelihood estimates of \(c\) and \(\phi\)
  by minimizing the negative conditional log-likelihood function.
\item Compare your results with the maximum likelihood estimate under the assumption of Gaussianity.
That is, redo the estimation by minimizing the negative Gaussian log-likelihood function.
\end{enumerate}
