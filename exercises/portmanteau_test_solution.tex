The Null hypothesis of \textbf{no remaining residual autocorrelation} can be rejected for the \(AR(1)\) model,
  but not for the \(AR(\hat{p})\) model.
This implies that the residuals in the \(AR(1)\) model are NOT white noise,
  while the residuals in the \(AR(\hat{p})\) model are LIKELY to be white noise.
In sum, both the information criteria as well as the Portmanteau test favor the \(AR(\hat{p})\) model over the \(AR(1)\) model.
